This project contains two folders, matlab and python, respectively. The former is used to preprocess and visualize CSI data, and the latter is our Dual-Attention CSI Network (DACN) for gesture recognition.

### matlab
For CSI visualization

Run QFM.m first to visualize CSI data from each TR pair to iamge first

Run StiFM.m to combine the image of each TR pair 

### python
Our Dual-Attention CSI Network

Run DACN.py to train and test network

da_att.py: attention modules

DACN.py: training the network

data-loader.py: dataset division

options.py: training options 

val.py: gesture recognition with the trained network
